# EDHM-UI for macOS / CrossOver

A macOS-native build of [EDHM-UI](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI), the configuration and theme manager for [EDHM](https://github.com/psychicEgg/EDHM) in Elite Dangerous.

This fork is intended for **macOS users running the Windows game through CrossOver**. EDHM-UI itself runs natively on macOS; it is not installed or run inside the Wine bottle.

## Release parity and provenance

This build is based on upstream EDHM-UI **v3.0.70** and bundles the Odyssey EDHM payload **v22.01**. It retains the upstream Windows application behavior while adding macOS/CrossOver support for paths, installation, themes, TPMods, and packaging.

The macOS work is maintained in the [`macos-crossover-poc`](https://github.com/ProbabilityEngineer/EDHM-UI-macOS-CrossOver/tree/macos-crossover-poc) branch. It is a fork/adaptation, not an official upstream macOS release. Upstream project and mod credits remain with [Blue Mystic](https://github.com/BlueMystical), [psychicEgg](https://github.com/psychicEgg), and the EDHM contributors.

## Download

Download the ZIP for your Mac from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ProbabilityEngineer/EDHM-UI-macOS-CrossOver/releases):

- **Universal** — Apple Silicon and Intel Macs (recommended)
- **arm64** — Apple Silicon Macs
- **x64** — Intel Macs

The app is ad-hoc signed. If macOS blocks the first launch, Control-click the app, choose **Open**, and confirm.

## Requirements

- macOS
- [CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover) with Elite Dangerous installed in a bottle
- Elite Dangerous Horizons or Odyssey installed through CrossOver
- The game must remain a Windows installation; do not copy it to a native macOS location

## Important: native side versus Wine side

| Component | Location |
|---|---|
| EDHM-UI application | Native macOS app, outside the bottle |
| Elite Dangerous | Windows executable inside the CrossOver bottle |
| EDHM files and DLLs | The Elite game directory inside `drive_c` |
| EDHM-UI settings/themes | `~/Library/Application Support/EDHM-UI-V3` |
| EDHM-UI cache/temp files | `~/Library/Caches/EDHM-UI-V3` |

## First-time setup

1. Install and launch Elite Dangerous through CrossOver once.
2. Launch the native EDHM-UI app.
3. Open **Settings**.
4. Set the following independently:
   - **Game folder** — the folder containing `EliteDangerous64.exe` inside the bottle.
   - **Bottle Root** — the CrossOver bottle folder containing `drive_c` and `user.reg`.
   - **Player Journal Location** — the folder containing the Elite `Journal.*.log` files.
   - **Graphics Config XML Folder** — the folder containing `GraphicsConfiguration.xml` and/or `GraphicsConfigurationOverride.xml`.
5. You can browse to the executable manually, or use the localization assistant while Elite is running at the main menu. The assistant can infer the bottle root from the running CrossOver process.

The usual bottle layout resembles:

```text
<your bottle>/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Frontier/EDLaunch/Products/elite-dangerous-odyssey-64
```

Do not assume this exact path; select the path belonging to your own bottle.

## Install EDHM

1. Close Elite Dangerous.
2. In EDHM-UI, select the configured game instance.
3. Choose **Install EDHM**.
4. Confirm the bottle and game paths.
5. The installer copies the bundled EDHM files, creates the required CrossOver-safe links for `EDHM-ini` and `ShaderFixes`, installs themes, and configures the CrossOver DLL overrides when possible.

The installer uses temporary extraction and copies through symlink targets. This is intentional and avoids the macOS/CrossOver failure where archive extraction treats `EDHM-ini` as “not a directory”.

## CrossOver DLL overrides

For the tested CrossOver configuration, set these bottle-level overrides to:

```text
d3d11            native,builtin
d3dcompiler_47  native,builtin
```

EDHM-UI can configure these from the EDHM DLL override control in Settings. Restart CrossOver/Elite after changing them. These are bottle-level settings and may affect other Windows programs in that bottle; uninstalling EDHM does not remove them automatically.

The tested working renderer is **DXMT**. D3DMetal may launch Elite, but EDHM themes did not apply reliably and could crash in the tested bottle. Steam/Epic launcher combinations and other CrossOver bottles still need separate validation.

## Using themes and TPMods

- Start Elite and leave it at the menus when testing setup.
- Select a theme in EDHM-UI and choose **Apply Theme**.
- Theme selection supports mouse and keyboard navigation: Arrow keys, Home, End, and Enter.
- The app now reports EDHM status and can enable/disable the paired EDHM proxy DLLs without uninstalling the mod.
- Install TPMods from the TPMods manager after EDHM has been installed for the selected game instance.

Do not delete the bottle's unrelated DXMT backup/version files. EDHM uninstall removes EDHM-owned files but intentionally preserves CrossOver DLL override configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Blank EDHM-UI window

This package is the native macOS build and should not need Wine rendering flags. If you are running the **Windows** EDHM-UI executable inside CrossOver, use:

```text
--use-angle=swiftshader --enable-unsafe-swiftshader --in-process-gpu --no-sandbox
```

Those flags are automatically applied by the Windows build when it detects Wine/CrossOver; they are not applied to the native macOS app.

### EDHM does not appear in game

- Confirm Elite is fully closed before installing or toggling EDHM.
- Confirm `d3d11` and `d3dcompiler_47` are `native,builtin` in the correct CrossOver bottle.
- Use DXMT rather than D3DMetal for the tested setup.
- Verify that the selected game folder is the one containing `EliteDangerous64.exe`.
- Reinstall EDHM from the app if the DLL pair or symlink targets are incomplete.

### Journal or XML settings are not found

Re-open Settings and select the actual host-side folders. The game folder, journal folder, graphics XML folder, and bottle root are separate inputs.

## Development

The current Electron/Vue source is in [`source_v3`](source_v3). Development builds use Node 22:

```bash
cd source_v3
npm install
npx -y -p node@22 -c 'npm run make'
```
