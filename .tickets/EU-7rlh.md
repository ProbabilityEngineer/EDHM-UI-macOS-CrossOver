# Add native macOS application menu Settings item

Expose EDHM-UI's existing Settings window through the standard macOS application menu bar. Preserve the existing in-app settings control and Windows/Linux behavior.

## Design

Build a native Electron application menu on macOS with the standard application menu and a Settings… item using the existing settings-window flow. Avoid duplicate settings windows and keep menu behavior platform-scoped.

## Acceptance Criteria

On macOS, the app menu bar contains a standard Settings… command that opens/focuses the existing Settings window; existing in-app settings still works; Windows/Linux behavior is unchanged; source build/lint validation passes.


## Notes

**2026-09-03T23:53:55Z**

Implemented macOS-only native Electron application menu with standard app/edit/window/help roles and Settings… (Command+,) command routed to the existing renderer settings flow. Added preload listener lifecycle and preserved existing in-app menu/platform behavior. npm run package passed; Vue LSP unavailable, JS diagnostics clean.
